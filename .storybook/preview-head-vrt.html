	 * While the rules above set animation-duration to 0ms for VRT builds, there can be times where this is not appropriate.
	 * For example if there is a constant animation in a story, it results in the animation running constantly at top speed and the VRT screengrab becomes somewhat undeterministic.
	 * Instead we can use the following .googlesitekit-vrt-animation-none in a story wrapper element to entirely disable animations for a given story.
